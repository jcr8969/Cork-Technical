## Cork-Technical TODO

What would I change given extra time?

I would have finished Part 2 (that is attempting to provide pagination for 
the GET assets). I would have also implemented more error handling (for example,
the GETALL assets should return a message if the database is empty)


What would I add to the API to make it more secure?

To make the API more secure, one could add encryption to the database, rather than
storing them in plaintext. 


Would I continue to use the same database?

I would not continue to use the same database. SQLite is very good for local systems,
however, it would not be the best to use for large networks where multiple people need
access to it at once over the Internet. Additionally, as stated above, I'm not sure
about the security measures of it. There are probably other types of databases that are
more secure.


Could the project be more portable?

Since I used the .NETT framework, it can be utilized on any Operating System (I know
for certain it works on Windows, Linux, and MacOS). Therefore, it is already portable.
